ReactDOM.render(
    <Timeline>
            <TimelineEvent title="John Doe sent a SMS"
                           createdAt="2016-09-12 10:06 PM"
                           icon={<i className="material-icons md-18">textsms</i>}
            >
                I received the payment for $543. Should be shipping the item within a couple of hours.
            </TimelineEvent>
            <TimelineEvent
                title="You sent an email to John Doe"
                createdAt="2016-09-11 09:06 AM"
                icon={<i className="material-icons md-18">email</i>}
            >
                Like we talked, you said that you would share the shipment details? This is an urgent order and so I
                    am losing patience. Can you expedite the process and pls do share the details asap. Consider this a
                    gentle reminder if you are on track already!
            </TimelineEvent>
    </Timeline>,
      document.getElementById('container')
);
```

1. `npm run storybook`: Start developing by using storybook
1. `npm run lint` : Lint all js files
1. `npm run lintfix` : fix linting errors of all js files
1. `npm run build`: transpile all ES6 component files into ES5(commonjs) and put it in `dist` directory
1. `npm run docs`: create static build of storybook in `docs` directory that can be used for github pages

The storybook artefacts can be found in `stories` folder. Run `npm run storybook` and you should see your code changes live reloaded on the browser
 
Also use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate release to npm. Use `npm run commit` to commit your changes and then `npm run semantic-release` to automate deployment and publishing to npm repository.
